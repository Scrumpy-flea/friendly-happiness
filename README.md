# Welcome to Friendly-Happiness. 

I'm creating my own cheatsheet. This will be an easy to use reference website for coding beginners.
I plan to cover HTML and CSS. I did consider Javascrit, but my website will be user friendly and Javascript is more complex. 

I feel the website needs to be less cluttered. It needs to feel more streamlined. There is too much information avaiable straight away. 
Perhaps, the starter page should include direct links to either HTML or CSS pages? 
Styling will be the same throughout. Perhaps more colours would be appealing. I'm thinking pastel shades and grey.
