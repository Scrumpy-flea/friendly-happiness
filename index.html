<h2 id="basic">Html For Beginners! </h2>
<p>Html stands for HyperText Markup Language. Html is primarly used for adding information to a webpage.
  I believe it is the first step towards creating a website. An Html element is a piece of content in a html document that uses
  the following syntax:opening tag, content, closing tag.</p>
<p>When starting a HTMl document for the first time, you need to start with &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. This tells the brower that you are working in the current version of HTML.</p>
<p>Then you need to place all of your code, inside another HTML tag. &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; The brower understands that all the code within those tags is HTML.</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Is the opening tag.</p>
<p>Hello World! Is the content</p>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;Is the closing tag</p>
<p>Html is organsied into a family tree type of structure, also called nesting. Elements that sit within other elements are the child of the bigger element.
  For example, the h1 element is the child of the element it is fitted into. Usually, the body or div elements.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some html tags have a specific purpose. eg, image or video tags.</li>
    <li>Most tags just describe the content, this helps us with styling later on.</li>
     <li>There are an infinate number of tags avaible </li>
     <li>Knowing when to use each one is based upon how you want to describe your html content.</li>
     <li>Descriptive, well chosen tags are the key to high quality web development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Table attributes.</h4>
  <d1>
    <dt>Scope attribute.</dt>
    <dd>Scope attribute can be added to the opening tag of td. It can take two values. <ol>
      <li>Row (heading for a row)</li>
      <li>Col (heading for a column)</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

       <h2>Types of lists</h2>
       <p>Some types of lists include:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Unordered list. <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span> This is an unordered list. </li>
         <li>Ordered list. <span>&lt;ol&gt;</span> Each item is listed 1, 2, 3 etc. </li>
         <li>Defintion list. Please see <a href="#deflist">here.</a>
         <li>Nested lists. These are list items nested within other lists. To create this you just use the <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span> tags within the list</li>
         <li></li>
       </ul>

      <h2 id="middlepage">Welcome to the middle of the page.</h2>
      <p>To make this header the target for my clickable link. I gave the header an id of middle page. Like this:</p>
      <p><span>&lt;h2 id="middlepage"&gt;Welcome to the middle of the page.&lt;/h2&gt;</span></p>

      <h2 id="deflist">Definition Lists, and definition of commonly used words.</h2>
      <d1>
        <p>Lets make a definition list of all the code words we need to learn. We can also learn how to make a defintion list at the same time!</p>
        <p>&lt;d1&gt; is the opening tag for a defintion list. &lt;/d1&gt; is the closing tag. All the elements of the defintion list should go between these tags.
          <br /> &lt;dt&gt; is the opening tag. &lt;/dt&gt; is the closing tag. The word we want to define should be between these tags.<br />
          &lt;dd&gt; is the opening tag for the defintion. &lt;/dd&gt; is the closing tag. The definition should go between these.
          sMake sure you keep each explination underneath the correct word.</p>
        <dt>Element</dt>
        <dd>In html an element is the opening, closing tag and the content that lies between them. The term tag is used interchangably with the word element. </dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Attribute</dt>
        <dd>Attributes tell us more about the content of the element. They are values added to the opening tag of an element. They change the elements behaviour. They appear in the opening tag of the element and are made up of 2 parts.
        a name and a value. These are seperated by =. The attributes name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying.
        The value is the setting for the name. It should be placed in "" Most attributes can only be used on certain elements, but some are interchangable.
        <br>Here is an example:<br><span>&lt;p lang="fr"&gt;Paragraphe en Francais&lt;/p&gt;</span><br>
        The attribute is lang, this tells us the language the element (paragraph) is in. The value of the attribute is fr, specifing it is in french. </dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Css</dt>
        <dd>Css stands for cascading style sheet. Css is a different language to html. You can do limited css in html, but it is better to keep the code in
          seperate documents. Css is used to style a html document.  </dd>
          <br>
        <dt>Syntax</dt>
        <dd>A Set of rules that define the combinations of symbols to be correctly structured. Each coding language has its own syntax.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
        <dd>Semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and closing links.
          For exmaple &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;artical&gt;, &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; are all semantic elements.
          Making the code easier to read for anyone else reading it.</dd>
          <br>
          <dt>Non Semantic html<dt>
            <dd>Non Semantic html is when an element does not describe what is contained inside it. For example &lt;div&gt; can be used to contian paragraphs or our header information.
            Making the code harder to read and edit. &lt;span&gt; is also a non semantic element. </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Validation</dt>
            <dd>Checking user provided data against required data. Validation is used when submitting a &lt;form&gt; For example, username and password.
              There are different types of validation.</dd>
              <br>
          <dt>Client Side Validation</dt>
          <dd>If we want to check the data sent from a form. This usually occurs before the data is sent to the server. Different browser do this differently,
           but the outcome is always the same. HTML5 do build in client side validation. This is good because it protects the server from bad code, or code which could be submitted by a
         bad person. It also saves time as we don't have to wait for the data to sent there and back. Also, quick feedback is availble for forms.
         So if a user submits a form with the information filling the required fields, they can quickly get it back without having to redo the form.</dd>
         <br>
         <dt>Server side validation</dt>
         <dd>Data is sent to another server for processing. For example, a login page.</dd>
         <dt>href</dt>
         <dd>Hyperlink reference. href is used to link to the address where the file is located. </dd>
         <dt>Relative Path</dt>
         <dd>Relative path is the file name that shows the path to a local file. (a file on the same website.)</dd>
         <dt>Absolute path</dt>
         <dd>A full URL. Which is stored in a different folder.</dd>
         <dt>DOM</dt>
         <dd>Document Object Model. This is the hierarchy all HTML follows. For example: parent element &lt;body&gtl; then has a child element, &lt;H1&gt;.
         The DOM holds all our elements, in the order that we have placed them.</dd>
      </d1>
      <br>
      <hr>


      <h2 id="family">The Coding Family tree</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>DOM = Document Object Model</li>
        <li>Code in html is organised into a family tree. </li>
        <li>When an element in nested into another element it becomes
        the child of the element it is nested into.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example:</p>
        <p><span>&lt;body&gt;<br /> &nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;p&gt;This paragraph is the child of the body element.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
        &lt;/body&gt;</span></p>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>These family tree links can go to great-grandchidren and even further.</li>
        <li>Child elements can inherit styling and behaviour from it's parent, via css.</li>
        <li>&lt;div&gt; is another element that is a container that divides the page into sections.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>useful for grouping elements together. So the code forms 'blocks'.</li>
          <li>Indent the tags inside div. So its a parent or grandparent tag.</li>
          <li>Div can contain any tezt, links images or videos.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h4>Attibutes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>An attribute is content added to the opening tag. They tell us more about the element.</li>
        <li>They have several uses, from providing information to changing styling.</li>
        <li>An attribute is made of two parts.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Name of the attribute</li>
          <li>Value of the attribute</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A commonly used attriubute is id. This can be used with any element. It is helpful when an element is being used more than once.</li>
        <li>id's have several different purposes.</li>
        <li>When we add id to a div tag. We add it into the opening tag. For example:</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span>&lt;div id="introduction"&gt;<br />&nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;</span></p>

      <h2 id="linking">Linking.</h2>

      <h4>Linking to other webpages.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Add links to other webpages using an anchor tag. &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</li>
        <li>Include the text you want the link rendered in between the anchor tags.</li>
        <li>Needs a href attribute with the link. As is this linking to an absoulte URL.</li>
        <li>Want a new window, so your webpage isn't lost when the user clicks your link?
          Use the target attribute and give it a value of _blank.</li>
        <li>You could put image as the clickable link. Just insert it between the anchor tags.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank"&gt; This is a link to wikipedia.&lt;/a&gt;</span></p>
      <p>Try this working link to wikipediea. = <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank"> CLICK HERE! </a>
        <hr>

        <h4>Linking to a relative page.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Linking to a relative page is just linking internal pages. (home, contents etc)</li>
          <li>for multi-page websites, files are stored in a "root directory" or a main directory.</li>
          <li>Html files are to be stored in the same folder. We can link these together with a relative path.</li>
          <li>We need to tell the browser the relative path. Basically, which folder's it needs to look in to find the relative page.</li>
          <li>Anchor tag is used with a href attribute.</li>
          <li>Using a ./ in the link tells the browser to look in the current folder.</li>
          <li>Don't forget to add a target attriubute of _blank. This will open the link in a new tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>&lt;a href="./contact.html" target="_blank"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;<span></p>
        <p><a href="./relative.html" target="_blank">More information here</a>
    <hr>

    <h4>Linking at will</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Not all links have to be text.</li>
    <li>You can turn nearly any element into a link.</li>
    <li>Wrap that element with the anchor element. eg, an image could be a link by wrapping the image tag in the anchor tags.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="Resources/dustin-humes-IyP6Y7LpOWY-unsplash.jpg" alt="a beauitful photo."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span></p>

<h4>Linking same page</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>These links can take a user to specific part of a page. Making the website easier to use.</li>
    <li>To create a same page link, we need a target. We must then give the target an id.
      This target can be given to most elements and should be descriptive.
      Making it easier to remember the links purpose.</li>
      <li>The link is a string. Containing # and the target elements id.</li>
      <li>Using id to link like this is good for the div element. As it can orgainise it and give the divs a title almost. Making the code easier to read.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span>&lt;a href="#middlepage"&gt;Go to middle of page.&lt;/a&gt;</span></p>
  <a href="#middlepage">Go to middle of page.</a>

<h2 id="images">Adding Media</h2>

<h4>Images</h4>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;img&gt; is a self-closing tag.</li>
  <li>src is a required attribute. src needs to be set to the location of the image.</li>
  <li>The / at the end of the code doesn't have to be there for it to render correctly. It's just good etiquette.</li>
  <li>alt is another attribute that can be used. alt means alternative text. Bringing meaning to the image if it won't display properly or a ereader visits the website.</li>
  <li>alt should be a discription of the image.</li>
  <li>Using alt helps search engines find your image. Improving the ranking of the website.</li>

<h4>Videos</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Video element requires an opening and closing tag.</li>
    <li>&lt;video&gt; tag requires a src attribute, with a link to the source.</li>
    <li>The source can be a file hosted with the site, or a URL that links to a video hosted on another site.</li>
    <li>Width and Height attributes are used to set the size displayed.</li>
    <li>Some attributes that can instruct the browser to alter playback:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>controls: Play, pause, volume control and full screen option.</li>
      <li>auto-play: Playing as soon as the webpage is loaded.</li>
      <li>loop: Continuously on repeat.</li>

  <h4>Audio </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;audio&gt; element is used to embed audio into a document.</li>
    <li>Use the source attribute to link to the video.</li>
    <li>Using the type attribute to specify what kind of video it is will help the browser with loading the audio. As the browser will know if it can support it.</li>
    <li>Some other attributes for &lt;audio&gt; are:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>controls: Shows the controls play and mute.</li>
      <li>src: specifies the URL of the audio file.</li>

  <li>The embed element can be used for any media content. eg, video, audio, gifs from an external source. </li>
  <li>This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites.</li>
  <li>&lt;embed&gt; is a self-closing tag, unlike &lt;video&gt;.</li>
  <li>embed can be used to add local files as well as media content from some other websites.</li>

<h2 id="form">Forms</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A form can be any type of input.</li>
  <li>Forms are sent over the internet, which is essentially a network of computers that send and recieve informertion.</li>
  <li>The hhtp request instructs recieving computer how to handle incoming information.</li>
  <li>The form element is great for collecting information.</li>
  <li>The element needs to be supplied with the location of where the form information will go, and what http request to make. eg:</li>
</ul>
<p><span>&lt;form action="example.html" method="POST"&gt; <br />&nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;/form&gt;</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Above is the skeleton of a form. It will send information to example.html as a post request. POST doesn't have to be in capitals, but it is good etiquette it do so.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>action decides where the information submitted is sent.</li>
    <li>method is assigned a http verb that is included in the http request. It determines how information is sent and passed.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>&lt;form&gt; can contain child elements. Eg, a header (What the form is about, or even a paragraph for more detail). For Example:</li>
</ul>
<p><span>&lt;form action="/example.html" method="POST"&gt;<br />&nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Creating a form.&lt;/h1&gt;
  <br />&nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;p&gt;More information to read.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The code above included no user input, but it is the foundations of a form.</li>
    <br />
    <li>&lt;input&gt; now needs a type. This determines how it renders on a page and what type of data it can accept.</li>
    <li>name is also needed. Otherwise the input won't be sent when the form is submitted.</li>
    <li>So what is typed into the box is sent with the name value. Typed as text when the form is submitted.</li>
    <li>So if 'important details' where typed into the box and sent. The text woule be:<br />
    'first-text'='important details' is sent to /example.html</li>
    <li>Because, the value of name is 'first-text' and the value of the value (textbox) is 'important details'.</li>
    <li>You can assign a default value for the value attribute. So a pre-filled text field appears.</li>
    <li>We also need a label, so users know what they need to input.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span>&lt;form action="/example.html" method="POST"&gt;<br />&nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;input type="text" name="first-text" value="already pre-filled"&gt;<br />&nbsp;  &nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Creating a form.&lt;/h1&gt;
    <br />&lt;/form&gt;</span></p>

  <form action="/example.html" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="first-text" value="Already pre-filled">
  </form>
